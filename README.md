## Chrome Devtools Refresh Btn ![refresh logo](refresh16.png)

This chrome extension simply reload's the current window and refocuses on the elements tab. TODO: find a way to refocus on previously shown tab.


####... _why?_
1. I wanted to learn more about chrome extentions
2. I'm lasy and want to refresh devtools without moving another finger ;-) Honestly though, other browsers have a refresh button in devtools, but not chrome for whatever reason.
